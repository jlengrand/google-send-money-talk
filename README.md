# Hey Google, send 20\$ to mum!

This repository contains the slides for my talk at [JFuture](https://jfuture.dev/) about [Virtual Assistants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant) and [PSD2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Services_Directive).

You can find the related code repository [here](https://github.com/jlengrand/dialogflow-fun).
This repository is hosted [here](https://github.com/jlengrand/google-send-money-talk).

## Slides

The slides are created using [DeckSet](https://www.deckset.com/), but there should be an uptodate pdf version available here as well :). Not affiliated in any way, I just liked the app.

_Please note that I'm using videos in the slides in case my live demo goes wrong, so this repository is quite large :). The deckset version of the slides does embed the videos, but the pdf version will only host screenshots._
